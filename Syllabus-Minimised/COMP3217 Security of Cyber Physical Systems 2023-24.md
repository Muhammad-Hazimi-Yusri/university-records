## Details

- **School:** School of Electronics and Computer Science
- **Module Code:** COMP3217
- **Credit Points:** 15
- **Level:** Level 6

## Staff

- **Module Lead:** Ahmad Atamli

## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For COMP3217 you must take: ELEC1201 OR COMP1202

## Aims

The aim of this module is to equip students with the necessary skills and experience to understand, and attempt to counter, the principal threats to data and electronic system security.

## Learning Outcomes

- **A1:** The range of cyber physical and software systems which present potential security hazards
- **B1:** Understand and recognise instances of the principal attacks on such systems
- **D1:** Take straightforward measures to protect systems from security breaches

## Syllabus summary

- Types of attack and attacker, range of systems - Side channel attacks: power analysis and resistant designs - Wireless ID: ISO14443, Mifare, E-Passports and related near-field communications systems - Card security, EMV payment systems, GSM and SIM cards - Physical security: chip and pin machines - Wired and WiFi network security - Examples of weak cryptosystems: GSM, WEP - Infrastructure attacks: smart grids - Trusted Computing and secure modules - Hardware Trojans and Trustworthy IC design

## Learning and Teaching Summary

Lectures are used to deliver the core knowledge. Hands-on laboratory sessions are used to explore the practical aspects of security of cyber physical devices. Further reading and code practice outside the lectures and laboratories will be essential.

### Study Time

- Completion of assessment task: 46 hrs
- Follow-up work: 18 hrs
- Lecture: 36 hrs
- Preparation for scheduled sessions: 18 hrs
- Revision: 10 hrs
- Wider reading or practice: 22 hrs
- Total study time: 150 hrs

## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

There will be four assessed practical laboratories, related to the topics taught in the module. Any externally repeating students will need to be present in Southampton during the exam period at the end of the relevant semester. At this time, they will be offered the opportunity to repeat the assessed laboratories.

### Summative

This is how we’ll formally assess what you have learned in this module.

- **Method:** Continuous Assessment
- **Contribution(%):** 100 %
- **Group Work:** Yes

### Referral

This is how we’ll assess you if you don’t meet the criteria to pass this module.

- **Method:** Set Task
- **Contribution(%):** 100 %
- **Group Work:** No

### Repeat

An internal repeat is where you take all of your modules again, including any you passed. An external repeat is where you only re-take the modules you failed.

- **Method:** Set Task
- **Contribution(%):** 100 %
- **Group Work:** No

### Repeat Year

Internal & External

## Costs

Further costs are available on Blackboard.

## Health & Safety

Security labs should be executed within the strict rules of ethical hacking.
