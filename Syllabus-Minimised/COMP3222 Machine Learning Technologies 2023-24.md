# COMP3222 - Machine Learning Technologies 2023-24

## Module overview

Machine Learning is about extracting useful information from large and complex datasets. The module will cover the practical basis of how learning algorithms are can be applied. You will gain hands-on experience in laboratory-bases sessions. Exclusions: Cannot be taken with COMP3206 or COMP3223 or COMP6229 or COMP6245 or COMP6246.
