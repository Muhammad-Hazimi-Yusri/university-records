## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

Weekly problem sheets and a mid-semester practice exam provide formative feedback. Technical labs consider MATLAB and RC Filters and Frequency Response, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes. They are conducted under the umbrella of ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module. A design exercise considers circuits and programming, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes, as well as those of ELEC1201. It is conducted under the umbrella of ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module and ELEC1201. Skills labs are conducted under the umbrella of the zero-credit ELEC1029 module and address its learning outcomes. The marks contribute to a number of ELEC12xx modules, including this one.
