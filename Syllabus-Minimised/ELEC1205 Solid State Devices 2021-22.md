## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

The tutorial sessions will be used for in-class assignments, feedback sessions and additional tutorials. These technical labs consider Semiconductor Spectroscopy and Solar Cells, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes. They are conducted under the umbrella of ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module. Skills labs are conducted under the umbrella of the zero-credit ELEC1029 module and address its learning outcomes. The marks contribute to a number of ELEC12xx modules, including this one.
