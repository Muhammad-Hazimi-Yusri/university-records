## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For ELEC2208 you must take: ELEC1200 AND MATH1055

## Aims

The module aims to provide a detailed understanding of all aspects of the selection, sizing and operation of modern electrical drive systems; this will be achieved by consideration of the individual sub-system including power semiconductors, electronic power converters and associated electric motors, mechanical power transmission, speed and velocity transducers, and controllers.

## Learning Outcomes

- **A1:** Understand the operation of modern drive systems applied to industrial applications including robotics and advanced machine tools
- **A2:** Apply your knowledge of the electrical characteristics of power semiconductor devices, to select power semiconductor devices for a range of applications
- **A3:** Understand the basic topology of converters, inverters and power supplies
- **A4:** Understand the dynamics of mechanical systems found in industrial applications
- **A5:** Characterise the operation of motors, drives, sensors and the mechanical power train within the drive system.
- **B1:** Perform design calculations for drive and power converter applications, and understand the approximations used
- **B2:** Understand the advantages and disadvantages that different motors drives will bring to an application
- **C1:** Transfer understanding and theories from one discipline to another, in particular from the mechanical design to the electrical power and control domains
- **C2:** Understand the wide range of issues that impact on the use of drive system in the industrial context, including safety, efficiency and costs (procurement, running and disposal)
- **D1:** Investigate the characteristics and performance of a power converter or electric drive
- **D2:** Analyse a specific application and produce the drive requirements that will result in the selection of sizing of a suitable drive system.
- **D3:** Demonstrate the basic skills required to operate a power converter and electric drive
