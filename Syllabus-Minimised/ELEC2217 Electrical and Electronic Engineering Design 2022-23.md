# ELEC2217 - Electrical and Electronic Engineering Design 2022-23

## Module overview

Conventional laboratory experiments are useful mainly to assist understanding or analysis: because they are of necessity stereotyped they are of limited usefulness when a circuit or system must be designed to meet a given specification. The majority of engineering tasks fall into this latter category, and therefore require design or synthesis skills that are distinct from the understanding of underlying engineering principles. This is additional to the analysis skills emphasised in the course so far. This module includes design assignments that have been devised to provide a bridge between 'conventional' experiments and the project work in the third and fourth years, (which, in turn, provide a bridge to 'real' projects in industry). The exercises have real deadlines and concrete deliverables and students are encouraged to be creative, develop imaginative solutions and to make mistakes. The assignments share common characteristics: - Customer orientated rather than proscriptive specifications are given - Design work carried out, bringing academic knowledge to bear on practical problems - Laboratory sessions are used for construction/verification of designs - Allow students to demonstrate their communication skills in writing individual and group reports/presentations. However the two design exercises have a different focus: - The D2 IC Deisgn Exercise involves design and test of a digital integrated circuit - The D5 Smart Meter Design Exercise involves design of a system that is able to monitor and control a micro-grid

## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For ELEC2217 there are no requisites.

## Aims

This module aims to introduce students to a range of electrical and electronic devices, and from this to provide an opportunity for them to explore the design process, to make mistakes and learn from them in a benign environment.

## Learning Outcomes

- **A1:** Defining the specification of an artefact that needs to be designed, tested and commissioned
- **A2:** The design process and the processes involved in project management
- **A3:** The problems associated with designing practical circuits and systems
- **B1:** Develop a plan for the implementation of the design and the undertake those activities
- **B2:** Analyse the design as it evolves, and deduce problems with the subsequent rectification
- **B3:** Undertake an evaluation of the complete design and prepare a critical precis
- **B4:** Appreciate the problems in dealing with uncertain and possibly ambiguous specifications
- **B5:** Synthesise simple circuits and systems, including the design of simple digital ICs
- **C1:** Write formal reports in a clear, technical style
- **C2:** Address problems associated with personal and group time management in a problem solving environment.
- **C3:** Demonstrate an awareness of team structure and dynamics, together with an appreciation of individual responsibilities working both as a pair and in a larger grouping
- **D1:** Undertake small scale mechanical and electronic construction
- **D2:** Undertake realtime programming
- **D3:** Undertake detailed faultfinding of the developed circuits if required
- **D4:** Demonstrate familiarity with the advanced use of function generators, oscilloscopes and complex devices such as logic analysers and spectrum analysers
- **D6:** Understand and interpret technical literature and data sheets.

## Syllabus summary

- The development of individual practical skills through completion of a simple build and test exercise, incorporating soldering, circuit construction and the manufacture of a container. - Groups of students are required to undertake a design, build and test project against a predefined specification. The project assessment includes a competitive trial, individual log books, group reports and quality assessment of the designed system. - The groups will have seminars on project management and principles of design to support the activities. - The specific design exercises will include: An IC design exercise incoporating design and test and a power engineering design exercise.
