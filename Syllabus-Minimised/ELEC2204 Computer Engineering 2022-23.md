# ELEC2204 - Computer Engineering 2022-23

## Module overview

This module looks at the how computer systems are designed and constructed, focussing on microcontrollers but also looking at how they fit into the context of other types of computer (e.g. DSP and desktop processor). It considers how data is processed and manipulated, communication via buses. It also looks at operating systems (including real-time systems), performance and benchmarking, and factors that affect the power consumption of systems. We also look at multicore and GPU processing, and development toolchains (how to get from C to optimised machine code).
