# ELEC6203 - Microsensor Technologies 2024-25

## Module overview

This module presents a broad overview of microsensor technologies, including the basic principles of measurement systems and the scaling effects arising from system miniaturisation. The practical component, assessed by a Lab Report, involves the design and construction of an interface circuit and subsequent characterisation of the performance of a microsensor. ELEC6203 is a prerequisite for ELEC6208 Bio/Micro/Nano Systems. Note that microfabrication techniques are covered in detail in ELEC6201 Microfabrication. The module uses COMSOL Multiphysics, a specialist finite element analysis tool, to model a MEMS sensor.
