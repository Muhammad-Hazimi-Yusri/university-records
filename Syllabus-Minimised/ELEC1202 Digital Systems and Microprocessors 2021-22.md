## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

Assessment on the module mixes practical and theoretical elements, and formative and summative elements. 4 Problem Sheets on different topics are spread throughout the module, to provide formative feedback. Two technical labs are also associated with the module; they are conducted under the umbrella of ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module. These technical labs consider Discrete Digital Circuits and Bus Operation and Control, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes. An end-of-semester design exercise considers digital systems and microprocessors, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes. It is conducted under the umbrella of ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module. Skills labs are conducted under the umbrella of the zero-credit ELEC1029 module and address its learning outcomes. The marks contribute to a number of ELEC12xx modules, including this one. An end-of-module exam provides summative assessment on all topics covered.

### Summative

This is how we’ll formally assess what you have learned in this module.

- **Method:** Continuous Assessment
- **Contribution(%):** 30 %
- **Group Work:** No
- **Method:** Final Assessment
- **Contribution(%):** 70 %
- **Group Work:** No

### Referral

This is how we’ll assess you if you don’t meet the criteria to pass this module.

- **Method:** Set Task
- **Contribution(%):** 100 %
- **Group Work:** No

### Repeat

An internal repeat is where you take all of your modules again, including any you passed. An external repeat is where you only re-take the modules you failed.

- **Method:** Set Task
- **Contribution(%):** 100 %
- **Group Work:** No
