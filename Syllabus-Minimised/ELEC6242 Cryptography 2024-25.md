# ELEC6242 - Cryptography 2024-25

## Module overview

This module covers the mathematics, techniques, and applications of modern cryptography. We will look at the history of code making and code breaking, and draw lessons for the future from the mistakes and successes of the past. We will also give a gentle introduction to the mathematics underlying modern cryptosystems.

## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For ELEC6242 you must take: (ELEC1201 AND MATH2047) OR (COMP1202 AND COMP221) OR ELEC6259

## Aims

To give a broad introduction into the subject of cryptography as it applies to electronic and computer systems

## Learning Outcomes

- **A1:** The historic struggle between code-makers and code-breakers
- **A2:** The broad categories of codes and ciphers, and appropriate uses for each
- **B1:** Perform simple mathematics appropriate to public-key encryption, and to cryptosystems based on polynomials over the binary numbers
- **C1:** Use graduate-level literature to investigate areas of mathematics previously unfamiliar to you
- **D1:** Attack classical ciphers such as Vigenère, and LFSR-based stream ciphers
- **D2:** Select appropriate ciphers, cipher modes, and protocols for simple applications
