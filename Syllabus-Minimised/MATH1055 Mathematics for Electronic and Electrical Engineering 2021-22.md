Complex numbers: graphical representation; algebra; polar form; Euler's formula and exponential form. 4. Differential equations : classification; simple first and second order differential equations. 5. Functions: inverse; trigonometric; exponential, logarithmic and hyperbolic. 6. Differentiation: maxima, minima and points of inflection; curve sketching; parametric, implicit and logarithmic differentiation; Taylor and Maclaurin series. 7. Integration: substitution; applications to centroids, volumes of revolution, etc. 8. Integration: rational functions; improper integrals. 9. Integration: double integrals; polar coordinates; triple integrals. 10. Differential equations: solution of first order ODEs (separable, homogenous, linear and exact). 11. Differential equations: linear operators; linear inhomogeneous second order ODEs; free and forced oscillators. 12. Vectors: basic properties; Cartesian components, scalar and vector products. 13. Vectors: triple products; differentiation and integration of vectors; vector equations of lines and planes. 14. Matrix algebra: terminology; addition, subtraction and multiplication of matrices; determinants. 15. Matrix algebra: inverse of a matrix using cofactors; systems of linear equations; inverse of a matrix using the elimination method. 16. Matrix algebra: rank; eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 17. Further calculus: chain rule for partial derivatives; higher partial derivatives; total differentials and small errors. 18. Complex numbers: trigonometric and hyperbolic functions; logarithm of a complex number; De Moivre's theorem; roots; simple loci in the complex plane. 19. Statistics: probability; conditional probability; combinations and permutations; discrete and continuous random variables. 20. Statistics: mean and standard error of sample data; normal distribution; sampling; confidence intervals; hypothesis testing.

## Learning and Teaching Summary

Teaching methods include • Self-study notes for each topic. • Examples and specimen test in each set of self-study notes, with solutions, for self-assessment. • Test at end of each topic is marked one-to-one with immediate feedback, at the rate of about two tests in three weeks. • Twice weekly timetabled workshops available. • Past examination papers and solutions. Learning activities include • Individual study of identified sections in course textbook. • Working through examples and specimen test for each topic in the set of self-study notes, with solutions provided.

### Study Time

- Independent Study: 149 hrs
- Teaching: 1 hrs
- Total study time: 150 hrs

## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

• The end of module examination is structured into two parts. The first part contains 20 multiple choice questions which test basic knowledge of all topics and whether simple calculations can be performed successfully. The second part consists of longer questions which test the depth of understanding of topics on the syllabus and the ability to carry out longer pieces of work. • The general skills elements are not explicitly assessed, but their development will reflect on the quality of the overall outcomes.

## Costs

Recommended texts for this module may be available in limited supply in the University Library and students may wish to purchase reading texts as appropriate.

Cost: No additional costs.

The core textbook (James, 5th edition) is essential for the course and has to be bought by the student. Theare are copies of the alternative core textbook (Stroud, 6th edition) in the Hartley library (8 copies, 2 in short loan, library code QA100 STR). Older versions of the core textbooks (James 4th or 3rd edition, Stroud 5th edition) can also be used, and the library holds several copies.

Cost: No additional costs.
