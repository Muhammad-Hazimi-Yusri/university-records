## Assessment and Feedback Summary

### Assessment Strategy

The technical labs relate to Ferromagnetic Materials and Performance Characteristics of DC Motors, addressing the above-listed learning outcomes. The technical labs are conducted under the umbrella of the zero-credit ELEC1029 but the marks contribute towards this module only. Skills labs are conducted under the umbrella of the zero-credit ELEC1029 module and address its learning outcomes. The marks contribute to a number of ELEC12xx modules, including this one.
