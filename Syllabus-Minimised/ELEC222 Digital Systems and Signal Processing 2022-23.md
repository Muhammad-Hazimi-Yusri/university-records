# ELEC2221 - Digital Systems and Signal Processing 2022-23

## Module overview

This module is taught by a combination of lectures, laboratory exercises and a design assignment. You will gain practical knowledge of digital system design and of digital signal processing in the context of modern systems. The design exercise is intended to synthesise both sides of the module content, so as to broaden and deepen understanding.

## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For ELEC2221 there are no requisites.

## Aims

To introduce techniques of designing robust, testable sequential digital systems, writing and debugging synthesisable modules in a hardware description language (SystemVerilog) and verifying the functionality of those modules by simulation. To provide practical experience in the design and diagnosis of sequential digital systems. To introduce concepts of stochastic signals, and to develop understanding of sampling, quantisation and coding in a signal processing setting oriented towards communications.
