# MATH2047 - Mathematics for Electronics & Electrical Engineering Part II 2022-23

## Module overview

The aims of this module are to: - Give students a solid grounding in mathematical methods and ideas in areas relevant to applications in engineering: Fourier series, Fourier transforms, eigenvalues, eigenvectors and eigenfunctions, linear ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and vector calculus. Feedback and student support during module study (formative assessment) - 3 coursework assignments which are collected up, marked and returned. - coursework assignments, solutions and past examination papers are available on website. Please see Blackboard for MATH2047 module information. https://blackboard.soton.ac.uk One of the pre-requisites for MATH3083 and MATH3084

## Requisites

Requisites are modules you must have before or at the same time as this module. For MATH2047 you must take: MATH1055

## Aims

• The coursework assignments cover the full range of topics of study, with all the questions being compulsory. They include multi-part questions to help students start and then develop solutions to quite substantial problems. • Completion of the coursework assignments should engender confidence in the use of all the mathematical methods needed to deal with the examination questions • To obtain full credit on coursework and examinations problems will require accuracy, and a coherent and logical presentation of solutions

## Learning Outcomes

- **B1:** Solve a variety of mathematical problems relevant to engineering
- **B2:** Show logical thinking in problem solving
- **D1:** Write up in an accurate, coherent and logical manner your solutions to a range of mathematical problems
- **D2:** Demonstrate organisational and time-management skills
