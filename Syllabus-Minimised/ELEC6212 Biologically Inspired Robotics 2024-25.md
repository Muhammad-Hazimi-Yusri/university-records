# ELEC6212 - Biologically Inspired Robotics 2024-25

## Module overview

This module lies at the intersection of robotics and biology. Through the abstraction of design principles from biological systems, it is possible to develop a range of core competences, including mechatronic systems, sensor and actuator technologies. By taking this module students will get an understanding of adaptivity and autonomy of animals through robotics, and have the opportunity to design, build and test novel robotic applications which are more adaptive, maneuverable, resilient, and energy efficient than current designs. Previous robots developed have included the Formica swarm robot, mobile platforms, swiming and flying robots, robotic heads and a range of advanced sensors.

## Aims

To provide an overview of biological inspired robotics

## Learning Outcomes

- **C1:** Work effectively as a group in a professional manner
- **D1:** Complete a self-directed design and build project relating to biologically inspired robotics.
- **D2:** Develop skills related to the design, construction and testing of advanced robotic systems
- **E1:** Have a deep understanding of bilogically inspired robotics and its current impact on robotic research.

## Syllabus summary

A number of introductory lectures will cover the following, prior to students developing their own designs. - What is a biologically Inspired Robotic System, and its advantages and disadvantages - Mobility systems (legs, swimming and flying system) - Sensors (tactile, vision, electronic nose, etc.) - Swarm robotics - Control architectures - Emerging fields of study. The purpose of the 3-4 introductory lectures is to give the students an appreciation of the scope of the subject and provide the knowledge and understanding to allow the groups to undertake research to allow the definition of the individual projects.
